### CODIO INSTRUCTIONS

## Running your code and tests

Note that the Codio menu now provides two modes of running your project:

*   Running the Java application in your browser

*   First "Compile" to update the code generated by your program.

*   Then use the "Run Java (GUI)" menu. This will start your application.

*   To view the running application, in the menu bar to the right of the previous item, select Pennstagram. Assuming that a program is running, it will show the running application in a new window or tab.

*   To run the JUnit Tests, use the "Test Project" menu item. (There is also
    an option in Codio under Tools -> JUnit (Beta). This will not work!.) 

## Zipping and Submitting

Once you are finished, use the "Zip for Submission" menu item to create a file called "hw06-submit(-time).zip" and upload it here:
